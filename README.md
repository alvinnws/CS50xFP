# Money Tracking Web App for iOS
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## Background
This project was initially created because I was unhappy with the state of available free mobile applications in tracking expenditure and income.

At the time of creation (start of 2023), I had long forgotten about CS50 as I put off making the final project due to lack of ideas. I completed all the required submissions for CS50 less the final project in the first half of 2022, and I am now coming back to submit this as my final project.

The project is basically a website. However due to Apple's integration of web apps, any iPhone user is able to add the website to their home screen as though it is a native app store application.
1. Press share button
2. Tap on "Add to home screen"

By adding specific headers in the html file, iOS recognises the website as a web-app

A large focus of this project was convenience, as it is built to meet my needs. I tend to be put off tedious tasks, hence by decreasing the number of steps to submit an entry to track I am more likely to continue tracking my finances.
It is optimised for my own phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max), but should work for any device.

## Description
This [simple web app](https://alvinnws.github.io/CS50xFP/) is available as a website and can be used as though it is a native app on iOS!
Tracking finances now requires only three steps:
1. Open website/web app
2. Fill in form (item name, type, cost)
3. Submit!

[View a summary of expenditure/income easily on google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s_R8YvkDq3Bcd8X3BZv3dQPO1gqdLQ9piugSX6aFgTg/edit#gid=130629116), and any other statistical breakdown, if needed, with a corresponding formula.

## Advantages
*Although the website is essentially a reskinned Google form, I believe it offers some advantages in accomplshing its goal*
### Features
- All features are free of cost and advertisements
- Any desired features can be added on
- Lack of unnecessary options/features
- Easy to submit responses
- Submitted responses are viewable on any device with an internet connection
### Optimisation/Customisation
- Optimised for viewing on my personal device
- Tailored to my own needs in terms of info to submit/data to present
- Every visual aspect, even the app icon, can be customised to individual liking (using css)
### Data
- Data processing can be done entirely on google sheets based on individual needs
- Can show summary based on time, category, amount spent, etc., provided a correct formula is used
### Misc
- Uses google forms but does not redirect user upon submission

## Disadvantages
- Public website means that should the website link be known to others, they are able to submit garbage responses to pollute my data
- Non iOS users would lack the same convenience (in stereotypical Apple fashion) due to lack of optimisation.
